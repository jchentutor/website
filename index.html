We have hired Jessy as a tutor for our son Julien over 3 years ago when he had to skip a math level during his sophomore year: Jessy was highly recommended to us and we were so thrilled with our son's progress after he first helped tutor him in Algebra and then for Geometry the following year. We loved how patient and approachable Jessy was and our son requested to keep him as his tutor. When it was time to study for the ACT, Jessy tutored our son again and was able to bring his score up over 3 points in a few months!  We have already referred Jessy to our friends and we highly recommend him!</p>

                    <p class="quote">I am a college student at Sacred Heart University. In high school and the first two years of college, I struggled greatly with the concepts of algebra and pre-calculus. Jessy provides a very good experience for tutoring. Unlike most tutors, Jessy teaches rather than reviews. When answers are difficult, he will not just give you the answers, he will walk you through every step that was covered in the session or previous sessions so you can understand the concept rather than just having the answer. I recommend Jessy Chen’s services to anyone who is struggling with math. I learned more in an hour session with Mr. Chen than I did in 2 years' worth of algebra in high school.</p>

My daughter struggled with online learning in calculus. Jessy was professional and provided her with clear, concise instruction. She was able to process the instruction and understand the concepts to allow her to improve in her coursework and tests. She was able to grasp the concepts with his instruction. He gives students the tools to learn and understand. He also gives parents feedback. She made a B, which she was thrilled about, as the beginning of the semester her grades were lower. He does not do the problems for the students; he walks them through so they can obtain the concepts steps, and confidence to master the problems and retain the information. Worth every penny! I referred him to my nephew who is utilizing his tutoring in AP stats!</p>

                    <p class="quote">Jessy was instrumental to my kids excelling in math this year. He broke down very hard concepts in Pre-Calculus honors and Math 1 and made my kids truly understand the material in a way that their teachers just couldn’t. As a result they felt so much more comfortable and prepared for their tests. My kids always loved their sessions with Jessy because they knew he would set them straight and they looked forward to working with him. As a parent, I loved that he was professional and organized and so easy to schedule sessions with. We look forward to using him next year for AP Calculus AB and Math 2.</p>
